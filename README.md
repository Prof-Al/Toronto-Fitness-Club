# Toronto Fitness Club
A group project where I used the Django and React frameworks to design a full stack interactive website for a fictitious gym business.

The website allows users to:
* Register & login to a customized user profile
* Subscribe to various membership plans
* Browse nearby studios with detailed amenity lists, photos and contact information 
* Search for studios through Google Maps integration
* Enroll in fitness classes offered at local gyms
* Manage your profile, subscriptions, classes and payment details via a comprehensive dashboard 
* Reigster superusers who can add, edit and remove data via an admin dashboard
